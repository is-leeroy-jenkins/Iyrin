___

Iyrin is a Streamlit-based geospatial, scientific-data, document-processing, and agentic-analysis application. It combines mapping services, environmental and scientific APIs, live-world operational data, document chunking, embeddings, vector storage, geospatial analytics, and provider-neutral tool interfaces in a single application.

## 🧠 AI / ML Functionality

### Document-to-Vector Pipeline

Iyrin converts supported API results, crawled web content, and loaded document text into LangChain `Document` objects. The processing pipeline is designed for retrieval-augmented generation, semantic search, downstream agent context, and ML feature preparation.

        ├──────────────► Chroma
        │
        └──────────────► Pinecone
```

### Chunking & Token-Oriented Preparation

- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` document segmentation.
- Configurable chunk size and overlap.
- Stable chunk identifiers written to document metadata.
- Processing-state isolation by application mode/source.
- Automatic invalidation of downstream embeddings when chunk settings change.
- Loaded-document, chunk, and embedding inspection tabs.

### Embedding Providers

| Provider             | Supported Models / Mode                                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI               | `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`                                  |
| Google Generative AI | `gemini-embedding-2-preview`                                                        |
| Mistral AI           | `mistral-embed`                                                                     |
| Hugging Face         | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` |
| Local GGUF           | Local embedding-capable GGUF models through `llama-cpp-python`                      |

### Embedding Validation

- One vector per document chunk.
- Consistent embedding dimensionality across a batch.
- Finite numeric-value validation.
- Provider/model tracking in Streamlit session state.
- Local GGUF model-file validation before model loading.

### Vector Storage

| Backend  | Functionality                                                                |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chroma   | Local persistent vector collections with configurable persistence directory. |
| Pinecone | Remote vector indexes with optional namespaces.                              |

Vectorized content is prepared for semantic retrieval, RAG pipelines, contextual search, and agent grounding.

### Agentic Tool Surface

`tools.py` exposes provider-neutral, JSON-serializable geospatial functions suitable for tool-calling integrations. The tool layer operates against normalized Live World session state rather than provider-specific payload formats.

Supported tool-oriented operations include:

- Live World operational status.
- Entity listing by normalized type.
- Entity search by identifier or name.
- Coordinate-to-entity nearest-neighbor queries.
- Great-circle distance calculations.
- Bearing calculations.
- Cross-layer geospatial context suitable for downstream agent reasoning.

The tool surface is intentionally decoupled from any single agent SDK. Provider registration can be performed by an external agent framework without changing the underlying Iyrin geospatial implementation.

### Geospatial Intelligence for AI/ML

The normalized `GeoEntity` model provides a consistent analytical feature surface across aircraft, military aircraft, satellites, vessels, earthquakes, fires, infrastructure, cameras, and additional map features.

Available features include:

- latitude and longitude;
- altitude/depth where applicable;
- heading;
- speed;
- observation timestamp;
- source identity;
- entity type;
- provider metadata;
- derived distance;
- derived bearing;
- geofence membership;
- entry/exit transitions;
- historical position sequences;
- tracking trails;
- cross-layer proximity relationships.

These features support downstream clustering, anomaly detection, classification, trajectory analysis, spatial-temporal modeling, semantic retrieval, and agentic decision-support workflows. Iyrin provides the data normalization, embedding, vectorization, spatial-analysis, persistence, and tool interfaces required for these workflows; supervised model training is not performed automatically by the application.
