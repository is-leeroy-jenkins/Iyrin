Live World Data extends Iyrin with a normalized operational geospatial layer built around the `GeoEntity` contract. Heterogeneous providers are converted into a common schema containing entity identity, type, name, latitude, longitude, altitude, heading, speed, timestamp, source, and provider-specific metadata.

### Live World Reliability

The Live World execution path is designed to keep independent providers operational even when one source fails or becomes unavailable.

- Independent refresh execution for the nine provider-backed Live World sources.
- Per-source status, last-attempt, last-success, error, and stale-data state.
- Previous provider data is retained and explicitly marked stale when a refresh fails.
- Provider failures do not stop later enabled providers from refreshing.
- Partial or stale refreshes are not persisted as new Historical Replay snapshots.
- Shared Overpass client behavior for Infrastructure, Cameras, and Map Features, including identifying headers, bounded retry, and fallback endpoints.
- OpenSky OAuth client-credential configuration with backward-compatible legacy environment aliases.
- Bounded Historical Replay persistence with configurable retention and per-source row limits.
- State-fingerprint deduplication for Earthquakes, Fires, Infrastructure, Cameras, and Map Features while moving entities continue to persist for trajectory replay.
- Historical replay limits select the newest records through the chosen snapshot and return them chronologically.
- Agent Tools and Historical Replay are rendered on the active Live World UI path with provider diagnostics and callable-tool inventory.

## 🧠 AI / ML Functionality

### Document-to-Vector Pipeline

Iyrin converts supported API results, crawled web content, and loaded document text into LangChain `Document` objects. The processing pipeline is designed for retrieval-augmented generation, semantic search, downstream agent context, and ML feature preparation.

```text

        │
        ├──────────────► Chroma
        │
        └──────────────► Pinecone
```

### Chunking & Token-Oriented Preparation

- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` document segmentation.
- Configurable chunk size and overlap.
- Stable chunk identifiers written to document metadata.
- Processing-state isolation by application mode/source.
- Automatic invalidation of downstream embeddings when chunk settings change.
- Loaded-document, chunk, and embedding inspection tabs.

### Embedding Providers

| Provider             | Supported Models / Mode                                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OpenAI               | `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`                                  |
| Google Generative AI | `gemini-embedding-2-preview`                                                        |
| Mistral AI           | `mistral-embed`                                                                     |
| Hugging Face         | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` |
| Local GGUF           | Local embedding-capable GGUF models through `llama-cpp-python`                      |

### Embedding Validation

- One vector per document chunk.
- Consistent embedding dimensionality across a batch.
- Finite numeric-value validation.
- Provider/model tracking in Streamlit session state.
- Local GGUF model-file validation before model loading.

### Vector Storage

| Backend  | Functionality                                                                |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chroma   | Local persistent vector collections with configurable persistence directory. |
| Pinecone | Remote vector indexes with optional namespaces.                              |

Vectorized content is prepared for semantic retrieval, RAG pipelines, contextual search, and agent grounding.

### Agentic Tool Surface

`tools.py` exposes provider-neutral, JSON-serializable geospatial functions suitable for tool-calling integrations. The tool layer operates against normalized Live World session state rather than provider-specific payload formats.

Supported tool-oriented operations include:

- Live World operational status.
- Entity listing by normalized type.
- Entity search by identifier or name.
- Coordinate-to-entity nearest-neighbor queries.
- Great-circle distance calculations.
- Bearing calculations.
- Cross-layer geospatial context suitable for downstream agent reasoning.
- Provider refresh status and stale/error diagnostics.
- Cross-Layer Analysis, Geofencing, Tracking, and Historical Replay status.
- Bounded retrieval of persisted Historical Replay observations.
- Full normalized entity-type parity, including Infrastructure, Camera, and Map Feature.

The tool surface is intentionally decoupled from any single agent SDK. Provider registration can be performed by an external agent framework without changing the underlying Iyrin geospatial implementation.

### Geospatial Intelligence for AI/ML

The normalized `GeoEntity` model provides a consistent analytical feature surface across aircraft, military aircraft, satellites, vessels, earthquakes, fires, infrastructure, cameras, and additional map features.

Available features include:

- latitude and longitude;
- altitude/depth where applicable;
- heading;
- speed;
- observation timestamp;
- source identity;
- entity type;
- provider metadata;
- derived distance;
- derived bearing;
- geofence membership;
- entry/exit transitions;
- historical position sequences;
- tracking trails;
- cross-layer proximity relationships.

These features support downstream clustering, anomaly detection, classification, trajectory analysis, spatial-temporal modeling, semantic retrieval, and agentic decision-support workflows. Iyrin provides the data normalization, embedding, vectorization, spatial-analysis, persistence, and tool interfaces required for these workflows; supervised model training is not performed automatically by the application.
